-Core Redux Concept
    1. Center Data (State) Store - only one store 
    2. Components  subscription receive state(data) from Center Store
    => components never directly manipulate the store data
    3. We use reducer function is responsible for mutating state from Center Store
     => not useReducer(), reducer functions are  general concept
    4. Action,  Components dispatch the action to change state from store 
    forwareded to Reducer Function
