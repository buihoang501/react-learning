React Context is a way to manage state globally. It can be used together
with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components 
more easily than with useState alone.

The React Context API is a way for React app to effectively produce global 
variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling"
or moving propss from grandparent to child to parent, and so on.Context is also touted
as an easier lighter approach to state management using Redux.
